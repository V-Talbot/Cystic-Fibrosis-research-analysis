## More examples of the plots
I have created this 'Plots' folder for your convenience when running my plotting programs because they generate so many files at once. The code is written to save those output files to this folder. (If you don't wish to do so, you can comment out that line of code or edit it to put it somewhere else.)

My box plot programs for the TIME Web Application output contain example images of what the output should look like. Here I include and legends for the plots of GP Microbiome output. Since I have multiple versions of plots of the same output which vary only in the number of operational taxonomic units (OTU's) are plotted per image file and how many files are produced, here I provide just one image file for each data type.
