## Troubleshooting 
At times the sites nbviewer, Binder, and Deepnote malfunction despite the programs themselves having no errors in them. Fixing these issues is usually a matter of doing one of the following: clearing the browser cache for that site, refreshing the page, or waiting 10 minutes. In addition, if you are new to the Binder and Deepnote platforms and intend to make major edits to the programs on either site, or want to add your own new programs, you should be aware that they require configuration files to set up the environment. For more on Binder's configuration files, see the documentation [here](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config_files.html). On Deepnote, the configuration files work in much the same way. Deepnote will also generate a 'requirements.txt' file for you to get you started if you don't already have one. My Binder configuration files are in the 'binder' folder and the Deepnote one is in the master branch of my repository. 

## Additional resources
Although the majority of the people who visit this repository will be well versed in programming, I wanted to offer a couple of  additional tips here for those who are completely unfamiliar with programming or Python. 

First, when running a Jupyter Notebook, you will have the option to run one cell at a time, or run all cells at once. I recommend taking one at a time, at least for the first time you run a program. This is, because, for instance, two consecutive cells might offer different versions of the same code and ask you to choose which you want to run, and running both will result in an error for one of them. 

Second, comments in programming explain to other people what the code is intended to do, or may offer an optional line of code. Python ignores thes lines. Comments in Python are preceded by a '#.' To un-comment a comment containing code so that the code will run, delete the '#.' To comment out a line, add a '#.'

Finally, there is an abundance of programming help available for open source software such as Python. Try searching the web or looking for video tutorials if you are stuck, or check to see if your local library has books on the subject.
