    "This program is written to take a file with observed relative abundances of bacteria for several of our CF study participants and split it into separate files, one for each participant. These files will be used later in my plotting programs. The code can easily be modified to split up any file with column names which contain variables such as ID numbers. \n",

    "The program demonstrates the process of splitting up the file with example data. The example data are designed to resemble our data in format and range, but are not real relative abundances. I have included both the example relative abundance file and a full explanation of how I created it in this repository, so that you can run it yourself. Although I encourage users to run this program and create the files themselves, I have also included a folder containing the output files in the 'Data' folder under 'Extras,' so that users can run the plotting programs without running this one first."
