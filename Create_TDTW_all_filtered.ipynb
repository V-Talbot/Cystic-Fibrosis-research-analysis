    "This program reads in and merges multiple output files from the [TIME](https://web.rniapps.net/time/index.php) pairwise Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) Distance workflow (Workflow 5b). The workflow allows for calculations across all samples as well as by condition. Conditions are part of the metadata entered into the application. Our conditions were 'Exacerbated' and 'Stable.' For my analysis, I used the following settings: a taxonomic level of 'Genus', the default DTW constraint of 2 and a 0.1 cutoff for ignoring rare taxa because my input data had already been appropriately filtered. The input data was not rarefied or normalised in the initial upload. The output csv files were automatically generated, with names in the following format:"
