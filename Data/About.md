## About the example data:
These example data files were created to resemble the CF Data, for anyone to use as inputs into my programs.

The files 405.csv, 453.csv, 480.csv, 500.csv, and 511.csv mimic output from GP Microbiome, and represent noise-free compositions of OTU's of bacteria. 

The files 405_both.csv, 453_both.csv, 480_both.csv, 500_both.csv, and 511_both.csv are similar, but also include predictions for noise-free compositions between samples and into the future, beyond the last sample. 

The file Example_rel contains the observed relative abundances of the same OTU's for the same participants, combined in one file. The program Create_relative_abundance_files_with_loop splits this file into individual ones for each participant, to be plotted against the output from GP Microbiome.
