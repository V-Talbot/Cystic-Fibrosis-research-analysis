# Cystic-Fibrosis-research-analysis
These programs visualize world-class repeated measures microbiome data from a cohort of well-characterized children with Cystic Fibrosis. Although these programs were applied to the real-life settings of Cystic Fibrosis, the theoretical framework it is based upon is applicable to a wide range of other studies featuring longitudinal microbiome data. 

# About this repository
This repository is intended to be a plain-English explanation of how to implement longitudinal microbiome analyses, using readily available software packages. Microbiome data is notoriously challenging to work with, and traditional statistical methods often fall short. For example, the frequent use of relative abundance data can cause different bacteria to appear to be correlated simply because the relative abundances must sum to 1. Therefore, I used several custom software programs specifically designed to be used with this data type. 

# The programs
The programs in this repository are written in Python 2.7 and Python 3.7.3 with Jupyter Notebook, and they visualize the output from two of the software programs I used: the [TIME Web application](https://web.rniapps.net/time/index.php) and [GP Microbiome](https://github.com/tare/GPMicrobiome), a Python-based program available here on GitHub.

The files are Jupyter (IPython) notebooks (.ipynb files). You can view them here, or [click here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) to view them on Jupyter's nbviewer website. If you want to *run* the notebooks, not just view them, you can clone the project, or run all the notebooks online by clicking this link: [Binder](https://mybinder.org)
