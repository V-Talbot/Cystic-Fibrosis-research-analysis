    "First, there are the observed relative abundance files, one for each participant. For the CF data, I ran the program Create_relative_abundance_files on a file containing observed relative abundance data for all participants, splitting it into individual ones. For the example data, I ran the same program on fictitious participants, with data designed to resemble the actual data. You can create those files yourself before running this program, and I encourage you to do so - especially since they also serve as part of the input for Leave_One_Out_Examples. However they are also included for your convenience in a folder called 'Relative Abundance Files' contained in the 'Data' folder under 'Extras.'\n",

This version of the program uses as input randomly generated example csv files, which are not actually output from GP Microbiome, but are designed to resemble it. I have included these files in this repository so that you can run the program as it is written and see the output for yourself. The code itself is identical to the code that I used, except for file names and a few comments. I have included those comments and file names for the convenience of those also working with the CF data.

To create plots with shaded backgrounds indicating binary variables over time - another type of visualisation that is not directly built in to matplotlib - see Plots_Shaded_Backgrounds. \n",

This means that positioning of markers differs for each participant and for plots with and without predictions, depending on what their statuses were, where I decided to make predictions, and how many predictions I made.\n",

The first method is more flexible, since it goes directly to the metadata, but the code for the second has useful applications beyond this program. Easily generalised, it shows how to force Python to recognize lists from a saved file as lists rather than strings. "
